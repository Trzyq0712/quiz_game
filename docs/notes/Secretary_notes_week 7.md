## Check-in
- Yellow flag for time distribution. Adjust the amount of time for issues between people. We can semi-artficially adjustt the time estimates to be more equal.
- Red flag Vian's lines of code. He had 300 lines of code. Should take some more issues this week.
- On track with the Musts.
- Not enough lines. According to a strange metric they expect us to have 3600 lines each because that is what was already given in the temlate project. Damla said not to worry about it too much since she is the one grading us.
- All green for everything else. We are on track.

## Planning
- Decide on Shoulds/Coulds to implement. We are unlikely to complete all.

### TODO
- Implement jokers in single-player.
- Enable multiplayer gameplay.
- Work on emote system for the multiplayer.
- Clean up MainCtrl so that only functionality connected with changing scenes stay there.
