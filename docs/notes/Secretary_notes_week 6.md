# Random notes

- Planning feedback
  - Distribute the issues evenly, maybe split larger issues.
  - Milestones seem to not be fulfilled, try to set up achievable milestones. Weekly milestones would be a good idea.
  - We need to have some sort of sprint and have weekly tasks.
  - Decide on the issues for that week as a group.
- Coding feedback
  - Coding is not continuous.
  - Make sure work is equally divided.
  - Estimate time on issues for that week as a group.
  - Add checkmarks to issues.
  - Can merge without closing the issue.
- Manage personal pipelines better (don’t keep pushing “Fix pipeline”)
- For code duplication, split up the MainCtrl into smaller classes
- Dividing tasks
  - Use milestones for dividing tasks.
  - Make a milestone for each week with multiple issues.
  - The issues should be small enough for one person.
  - We can work on both client and server.
