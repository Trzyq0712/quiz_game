**Role of Secretary**

The secretary is responsible for taking notes during the meeting but also helps the chair with preparing and following up on action items. In addition, the secretary is responsible for communication with team members and the teaching assistants and for organizing documents. This means that the secretary is responsible for submitting documents to Brightspace on time.

**Tips for taking minutes**

- Prepare the meeting well, so you know the agenda items and objectives. 
- Limit the minutes to what was discussed and decided in the meeting.
- Make a clear note of the actions: what the agreement entails, when the action must be carried out, and who is responsible.
- Elaborate on the notes and share with team members and/or non-team members.



Take minutes of what was decided and what actions were taken

Record (so write down) what was decided and what actions there are. You are free to take detailed notes of the entire meeting. But it can take a lot of time and is not always necessary. Therefore, it is recommended to limit yourself to the main discussed topics and to list decisions and action points. This is sufficient for keeping track of your project meetings. You can, for example, use one list that is attached at each meeting with the new decisions and/or actions. You can think of tools like Miro or Trello and such to keep track. Each decision must be accompanied by the date (i.e., during which the meeting) the decision was taken. We provide a solution for this in the template below.

**Approve minutes of prior meeting**

There was no secretary for the prior meeting.

**Dividing tasks- so everyone knows what to do**

We decided to divide and organize the work that must be done for the backlog and the HCI assignment. 

The backlog has two parts, 											1. Formatting the document we have into “AS A [ROLE], I WANT TO [FUNCTION] BECAUSE [REASON] or at least something like it. Also formatting by dividing some points that are too big and contain other points (for example, the point about the jokers)						 2. Put them as issues in GitLab. **TA Recommendation**: add tags in GitLab according to the MoSCoW principle. It will be easier to find things afterwards. Write as a title what we have written in the document about the requirements, and in the description write what must be done technically.

We also talked about 

**Summary of action points**

**Useful info from asked questions?** 

- CheckStyle can be plugged in to IntelliJ. Also in git, it will check the style before each merge. We can it to the pipeline or locally, or both.
- HCI assignment template can be found on BrightspaceàOOPProjectàContentàHuman-Computer InteractionàHCI assignment.
