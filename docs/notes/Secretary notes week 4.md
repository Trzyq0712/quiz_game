Agenda items 

Testing – the testing approach that is needed for this project
Testing approach – not yet established as a team. 
Testing shouldn’t be a main priority but should be part of the development. We should focus on the things we can test. Only basic unit testing is expected, everything else is not required.
Branch coverage checks if all possible paths are tested. Good indication to see if all our tests are working. 
Tests in the template are just for us to get an example. We should create our own testing folder. 
Testing is a small part of the grade. The process of testing as we’re working matters.

HCI report draft – Feedback
Prototype: add description to the pictures. Explain what buttons do / which screen it is.
Method: better description of evaluators. Better explain their HCI background (education, expected experience in a bit more detail).
Procedure: not detailed enough, should be a little more specific. Add that they need to look through it more than once. 
Results: make it in written format. Table does not count for the word count. Describe them in blocks of texts based on heuristics. We could even do a chart to mention the most important issues and their severity. Keep the priority matrix. Make sure issues are still identifiable. Create a “raw data” spreadsheet with the table that is right now in the document.
Matrix: add definition of “frequency” and “impact” to make it more specific and well-defined.
Let readers know how important each issue is based on impact/frequency.
Reasons: replace this session with what is written in the paragraph above; add a definition for “importance”. Should be generalised, not this specific. Justifications could be done inside paragraphs. Focus on how important we think each issue is. 
Conclusion & improvements: mention that issues were ordered by importance (improvements). Mention which issue was solved. Motivate your choices (what you improved and why do you think it is important).
References: HCI-related, heuristics etc. Have a “Reference” rubric at the very bottom.

Spring & JavaFX
We still need to look through the content.
We’re going pretty slow at the moment. We should start picking up the pace with coding.

API
It is pretty basic at the moment. Work on connection to the repo & the pipeline. Make sure that’s done by week 6.

Upcoming deadlines
•	HCI report this Friday.
•	Adding questions in the activity bank (20 total), also this Friday.
•	Friday, week 5: Buddy check; anonymous review of each other. Be honest and constructive about it. Mandatory to pass the course! The Buddy Check has a ”note to course” rubric – any personal circumstances can be addressed there.

Feedback round
Reinier chaired the meeting really well.
We have not missed any deadlines.
The HCI draft was well done.
Start coding!


Any questions? 
The Thursday meeting will be held at 1PM.

Closing.
