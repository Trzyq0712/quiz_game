#Code of Conduct

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.


#Assignment description

In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.

**In this course, we are tasked with developing an application using Git and the Spring framework. The project consists of a quiz having the theme of Energy Awareness.**

**Our project consists of a quiz game with multi- and single-player game modes. The players should answer a few questions regarding energy consumption and try to guess the correct answer. The goal of the game is to raise awareness of energy waste.**

**For creating the game, we are using the Spring Boot framework for developing the back-end, and JavaFX for the front-end.**


#Target or ambition level

What grade are you working for?

**We would like to do as much as we can, by implementing correctly and fully all the Must, Should and Could, we aim to get at least an 8. If time allows us, we will try to implement the Would, to increase our chance to get a higher grade.**


#Products

What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

**At the end, we should deliver a working game having implemented all the required features. In addition, we will provide the source code of the project, the HCI findings that belong to the game, tests for the code and our exported database. We use Gitlab for the code and agenda and Mattermost for casual help and discussion. The work submitted must adhere to the style check and must pass the build server’s tests. Moreover, for the project we will aim towards 100% test coverage.**


#Planning

How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace *on behalf of the project group?*

**For everyone to finish their tasks on time we will divide the work into similar portions of workload and communicate our progress every 2 days. We decided that the final week’s Chairman should have the final say in the submission, so the Chairman submits the work to Brightspace on behalf of the group.**

**We have meetings and work together every Thursday, and the course deadline is usually Fridays. So, we decided to have our own deadline as Thursday prior to the actual deadline. Thursdays, there is an opportunity to work on what we must hand out and talk with the group if needed. So, most of the work must be done before the meeting to allow constructive review and discussions about the assignments. Everyone should review the work before Friday noon (doable because we do not have lessons on the first two hours of Friday morning) and give their feedback, if the work is done before Thursday meeting, the review should be done before Thursday night.**

**We will upload the time estimation for the issues to be completed, to allow better equal distribution of workload. The person working on the issue should say how much time it really took, so adjustments can be made. We will start with the most important issues (labeled as Must). If someone has a special interest in one of them, they can work on the issue. If there are no specific interests and the issues have the same workload, the issues will be split randomly (rolling a dice or picking the issues written on a card).**

**There will be a rotation for working on the server side or the client side. In this way, there always is someone who knows what has been going on and can explain to the ones recently working on that side if needed.**


#Behavior

How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

**We will treat each other with respect and make sure everyone’s opinion is heard.**

**Small disagreements in the group should be resolved by reaching a team consensus. For example, if one person does not agree on the design of the application, the group would acknowledge their opinion and consider its viability. If a team consensus is not reached, we go by the majority vote.**

**However, if the group is not willing to agree on something, the last resort should be asking our TA for feedback and conflict resolution.**

**We define small disagreement as any minor inconvenience regarding individual features or visual details of the application, e.g., style or location of a button on the screen.**

**If someone is late for a group meeting by more than 5 minutes, they must bring snacks to the next meeting. If we notice that the same person is late or absent frequently, we try to find out the cause of this and get them back on track. If that fails, we will reach out to our TA for help.**


#Communication

In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

**We set up a WhatsApp group where we discuss small matters. When needed, we also use Mattermost for more formal discussions and whenever we need to reach out to our TA.**

**We also use Gitlab to communicate our concerns about the application and the merge requests.**


#Commitment

How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality?

How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

**We will make use of Gitlab and review each other’s code and make sure it passes the code quality checks. For the quality of the Chairman some good aspects could be that there are not that many extra questions which means that the Chairman’s prepared questions covered most of what needed to be covered. A good agenda should have those questions and extra time for team members to voice their opinions on other matters at some point of the meeting. Another example could be HCI methodology. Quality in this case may mean that it is written in a formal manner, it is concise and accurate.**


#Meetings

How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

**We will meet twice a week: once on Tuesday before the meeting with the TA and once again on Thursday at 2pm. The Tuesday meetings are usually held one hour prior to the TA meeting. Their purpose is to make sure that we will address everything that is necessary with the TA. The Chairman and the Minute Taker need to prepare their documents. The Thursday meetings are meant for us to work together on the project and make sure that we communicate any issues we face. Preparations will not always be necessary, but if any task comes up, we should make sure that it is done prior to the meeting if it is individual. If teamwork is necessary, we will solve it during the meeting.**

**These meeting are established by us and are not strictly mandatory, therefore cancellation or postponement of the meetings can occur when a team consensus is reached. Additional meetings can be arranged if extra group work is needed. It is acceptable that only a part of the group meets. We should announce our teammates the day prior, before 8pm, if we want any changes of the schedule. Last minute meetings can be scheduled, but the team members are free not to come if they are not available.**


#Decision-making

How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

**First, we will try to reach a decision by consensus, but if that takes too much of our time, we will have a majority vote.**

**Here is the way we will make decisions: First we try to come to a consensus, if everyone does not have the same opinions and not everyone directly agrees, we must see if we have enough time or not, because this way of making decisions is time-consuming. Then, we will try to vote, so a democratic decision. Because the majority does not always have the best idea, we will have a quick round for the minority to defend their idea in 1 minute. Then another vote takes place, and the majority will have the final say.**


#Dealing with conflicts

How do you handle conflicts within the group?


**As mentioned in the Behavior rubric, small disagreements in the group should be resolved by reaching a team consensus. However, if that is not possible, and majority vote also fails to make us reach a decision, we should ask our TA for feedback.**

**We aim to make sure that everybody is satisfied with the outcome, and we will try our best to solve any conflict as well as possible.**


#Guidance

What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

**We expect that the Student Assistant can guide us towards making an impactful decision and help us with conflict resolution. We primarily want feedback on the content.**


#Consequences

What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?


**We will inform our TA about the situation and follow her instructions if talking to the person does not solve the issue. If a person misses their personal deadline, we consider how much time is left before the main deadline. If there is not enough time, we try to share the issue and finish it, otherwise we give them a chance to finish it. After a team member misses 2 deadlines, we will try to contact the TA on this matter.**


#SuccessFactors

What makes your team a dream team?

**We strive to be a dream team by**

- **communicating openly**
- **dividing tasks equally**
- **meeting deadlines**
- **creating a helpful workspace**
- **playing to the strengths of everyone’s Belbin roles**
